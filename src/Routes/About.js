          Hi, my name's Nick. I currently work as a chemical engineer in
          research and and development. My goal is to change career paths and
          take the dive into software development. I want to work somewhere
          where I can meaningfully contribute to projects I work on, build on my
          skills, and help to innovate in a fast paced and ever-evolving
          industry.
        </p>
        <p>Here's where I've worked so far:</p>
        <JobList>
