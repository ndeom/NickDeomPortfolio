## Portfolio

Hi, my name's Nick. I currently work as a chemical engineer in
research and and development. My goal is to change career paths and
take the dive into software development. I want to work somewhere
where I can meaningfully contribute to projects I work on, build on my
skills, and help to innovate in a fast paced and ever-evolving
industry.
